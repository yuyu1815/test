/**
 * Compose or user code can't work well if we miss some events.
 *
 * This class generates new synthetic events based on the previous event, if something is missing.
 *
 * Synthetic events:
 * 1. Synthetic Move, if we miss Move before Press/Release events with a different position
 * for Mouse.
 *
 * Reason: Compose can receive a native Move and send it as Enter/Exit to the nodes.
 * If we don't have some Move's before Press/Release, we can miss Enter/Exit.
 *
 * The alternative of sending synthetic moves is to send a native press/release as
 * Enter/Exit separately from Press/Release.
 * But this approach requires more changes - we need a separate HitPathTracker for Enter/Exit.
 * The user code  won't see anything new with this approach
 * (besides that Enter/Exit event will have nativeEvent.type == Release/Press)
 *
 * We don't send synthetic events for touch, as it doesn't have Enter/Exit, and it will be
 * useless to send them.
 * Besides, a Release of touch is different from a Release of mouse.
 * Touch can be released in a different position
 * (the finger is lifted, but we can still detect its position),
 * Mouse can't be released in different position - we should move the cursor to this position.
 *
 * 2. Synthetic Press/Release if we send one event with 2 pressed touches without sending 1 pressed
 * touch first. For example, iOS simulator can send 2 touches simultaneously.
