  <p><strong>Version 1.0, effective as of December 16, 2024</strong></p>
  <p>Welcome to Junie!</p>
  <p>These EAP Terms of Service constitute a legally binding document, and it is important that You read them carefully.</p>
  <p>JUNIE IS A PLUGIN THAT ALLOWS YOU TO IMPROVE YOUR USE OF OTHER JETBRAINS PRODUCTS BY CONNECTING THEM TO AI SERVICES PROVIDED BY JETBRAINS DIRECTLY OR IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THIRD PARTIES.</p>
  <p>IF YOU USE JUNIE, WE WILL SEND YOUR INSTRUCTIONS AND SOME OTHER INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES PROVIDING SERVICES BASED ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OR MACHINE LEARNING IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE CONTENT OR OTHER OUTPUT FOR YOU. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR INPUTS AND DATA WHICH YOU DECIDE TO SHARE WITH THESE PARTIES THROUGH USE OF JUNIE AND FOR WHETHER THAT INPUTS OR DATA CONTAIN ANY SENSITIVE OR OTHERWISE PROTECTED INFORMATION.</p>
  <p>JUNIE IS STILL IN ITS EARLY STAGE AND HAS AN EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTER, AND THE OUTPUTS MIGHT NOT ALWAYS BE CORRECT. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR EVALUATING WHETHER THE OUTPUTS ARE CORRECT AND FIT FOR YOUR PURPOSES. PLEASE NOTE THE DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY BELOW IN SECTIONS 7 AND 8, AS WELL AS THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS IN SECTION 6.</p>
  <p>WITH YOUR ADMISSION TO THE EAP, YOU ARE GIVEN THE RIGHT TO ACCESS, USE, AND EVALUATE JUNIE FOR FREE WITHIN THE EAP. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE THE TERMS OF THE EAP, DENY OR LIMIT ACCESS, OR END THE EAP AT ANY TIME.</p>

JetBrains and Customer may each also be referred to individually as a “<strong>Party</strong>” or jointly as the “<strong>Parties</strong>”.</p>
  <p>If You accept these Terms on behalf of a legal entity, You confirm (‘represent and warrant’) that You are authorized to enter into agreements on behalf of that legal entity.

  <p><strong>b) Definitions</strong></p>
  <p>There are also words or phrases in these Terms that have a particular defined meaning. When the word or phrase is used for the first time, it is defined and capitalized. These Terms also use the following definitions:</p>
  <p>“<strong>Affiliate</strong>” means, with respect to any party, any entity that directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control of that party. ‘Control’ for such purposes means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or affect the direction of the management and policies of a person or entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise. You are responsible for the compliance of Your Affiliate with these Terms.</p>

System-generated data includes aggregate anonymized data on how Junie is used, system logs, metadata, registration and login data, and data required to provide support.

You also indemnify Us from any liability relating to this Input and Your Data (see the ‘Indemnification’ Section).</p>
  <p><strong>c) Your rights to use Outputs</strong></p>
  <p>The Outputs generated for You will be considered Your Data, and We will not claim any right to, title to, or interest in them. You acknowledge that Outputs are generated as a non-exclusive response to Your work with JetBrains Products, so the same or similar Outputs can also be generated for other Junie users, based on their inputs or context of their use of JetBrains Products. You also understand that the Outputs are sometimes a result of third-party large language models and as such can be subject to third-party rights, including open-source licenses.</p>
  <p><strong>d) Feedback</strong></p>
  <p>You give Us the right to use, change (‘modify’), commercialize, and incorporate into Junie any of Your ideas, suggestions, recommendations, proposals, or other feedback relating to Junie.

  <p>ii) <em>For security reasons</em> – We can access Your Inputs, Your Data and Outputs if We have a good reason to (‘reasonably’) believe this access is required to maintain the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, performance, and resilience of Our systems and Junie; and</p>
  <p>iii) <em>If We are legally required</em> – We have the right to access, review, and remove all or a part of Your or Your Users’ Inputs and Outputs if We have a good reason to (‘reasonably’) believe that the Input or Outputs breach the law or these Terms. You understand that there are laws that could require Us to disclose Your Inputs, Your Data and Outputs and, if these laws apply, We are obliged to comply with them.</p>
  <p><strong>b) Permission to handle Your Inputs and Your Data</strong></p>
  <p>If You use Junie, You give (‘grant’) Us certain permissions (‘rights’) so that We can provide the Junie service to You. Each of these permissions takes effect immediately when Your Input together with Data is submitted to Junie. You understand that these permissions are necessary in order to use Junie and You will not receive any payment for them.</p>
  <p>You give Us permission to process your Inputs together with Your Data and to share them with the provider of the AI Service for the purpose of generating the Outputs. The list of AI Service providers is published at <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/terms/jetbrains-ai/service-providers/" class="uri">https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/terms/jetbrains-ai/service-providers/</a> and can be updated by Us at any time through the publication of a new list.

  <p><strong>c) Use of Your Inputs, Outputs and Data for Junie improvement</strong><br />
    For the duration of the EAP Term, You also give Us permission to host, store, alter Your Inputs, Outputs and Data in Junie, copy it to Our database, make backups, and analyze it on Our servers to understand the usage of Junie and identify opportunities for its improvement. It does not permit Us to sell or otherwise transfer ownership of Your Inputs, Outputs or Your Data to a third party, train any machine learning models that generate code, text, or another type of data from which Inputs, Your Data and Outputs could be extracted, or reveal the Inputs, Outputs or Your Data in any form to other users of Junie.</p>
  <h2 id="indemnification">6. Indemnification</h2>
  <p><strong>a) Indemnity</strong></p>
  <p>If there are any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, or fees and similar expenses, including fair (‘reasonable’) attorney fees, brought against Us or the providers of AI Services connected to Junie that are related to any of the following claims (each of these is defined as a &quot;<strong>Claim</strong>&quot;):</p>

  <p><strong>b) Indemnity claims</strong></p>
  <p>We will quickly (‘promptly’) let You know if someone makes a Claim. If We fail to let You know quickly, then that failure will only affect Your obligation to indemnify Us to the extent that Our failure to inform You quickly adversely affected Your ability to defend Us against the Claim. When You are defending Us against the Claim, You can choose Your own lawyer, with Our written permission. If You have Our written permission, You can resolve (‘settle’) the Claim as You decide (‘at Your discretion’). However, We can take full control of Your defense and settlement at any time.</p>
